# PulseWatch

PulseWatch is a lightweight system and uptime monitor written in Python. It periodically checks your computer’s CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and internet connectivity, then logs the results to a file with timestamps. This makes it useful for spotting performance issues, detecting internet dropouts, or keeping a simple health record of a machine over time.
